**Glossary of FinTech Technology**   	
This glossary consists of terms and definitions that are relevant to FinTech Technology. It is a quick and dynamic reference for students and those interested in FinTech Technology.
The Glossary is a project at Our Best Words Communications Course and indicates the ability to generate content in Markdown and create glossaries of technical terminology in different fields.

###A
**#ALTERNATIVE FINANCE**
The term "alternative finance" refers to various financing options that are not standard (stocks, bonds, cash). Peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding are examples of the financial products, instruments, and techniques that fall under this umbrella term created outside the conventional financial services sector.
APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API)
A set of procedures, protocols, and tools known as an application programming interface (API) are used to create software programs that essentially enable different systems or applications to "talk" to one another. According to the demands of the user, API enables program modification and can speed up routine tasks.

###B
**BITCOIN**
Bitcoin is the original digital asset referred to as a virtual or digital currency. It is like an online version of cash. In some instances, one can use it to buy products and services.
BLOCKCHAIN
A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a computer network's nodes. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in a digital format which requires entries to be confirmed and encrypted via an advanced encryption technique called cryptography. The innovation of a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and is best known for its crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions.

###C
**CRYPTOCURRENCY**

A cryptocurrency is a digital currency, an alternative form of payment created using encryption algorithms. Encryption technologies mean that cryptocurrencies function both as a currency and a virtual accounting system. Examples of a cryptocurrency include Bitcoin and Ether.

###D
**DIGITAL ASSET**

In the context of blockchain, digital assets include cryptocurrency and tokens; a non-tangible asset is created, traded, and stored digitally. Anything in digital form could create value via tokenization on a blockchain.


**DISTRIBUTED LEDGER**

A distributed ledger is a database that is consensually shared and synchronized across multiple sites, institutions, or geographies, accessible by multiple people. Any changes or additions to the ledger reflect and are copied to all participants in seconds or minutes. Participants at each node of the network can access the recordings shared across that network and own an identical copy.
Underlying distributed ledgers are the same technology used by blockchain, which is the technology used by Bitcoin. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger used by Bitcoin.

###E

**ETHER**
Ether is known as the fuel for operating the Ethereum platform. Like other digital currencies, Ether can be used to pay for goods and services. Nevertheless, even though a transactional token, Ether is used to support the development of applications on the Ethereum network.


###I

**INITIAL COIN OFFERINGS (ICO)**
The counterpart of an IPO in the cryptocurrency world is called an initial coin offering (ICO). An ICO can be used to acquire money for a business that wants to develop a new coin, software, or service.
To get a brand-new cryptocurrency token that the business has issued, interested investors can invest in an initial coin offering. A share in the business or project may be represented by this token, which may also have some utility in relation to the good or service the company is providing.

###M

**MINING**
New Bitcoins enter into circulation through mining. It is also how the network confirms new transactions and is a critical component of the blockchain ledger's maintenance and development. "Mining" is performed with sophisticated hardware to solve highly complex computational math problems. The first computer to find the solution to the problem receives the next block of bitcoins, and the process begins again.


**N**

NON-FUNGIBLE TOKEN (NFT)
A non-fungible token (NFT) is an exclusive digital identity used to verify ownership and authenticity and cannot be duplicated, replaced, divided, or added to an open blockchain, such as Ethereum's. The blockchain contains information about who owns an NFT. NFTs can be sold and traded since the owner can transfer them.

###P

**PEER-TO-PEER**
A peer-to-peer (P2P) service is a decentralized platform whereby two individuals interact directly with each other without intermediation by a third party. Instead, the buyer and the seller transact directly via the P2P service.

**PUBLIC KEY**
The password for your virtual wallet, which you give to others so they can send you virtual money. Users can receive cryptocurrencies into their accounts thanks to the usage of public keys, which are cryptographic codes that simplify transactions between parties.
When starting a transaction, users are given private and public keys.

**PRIVATE KEY**
Confidentiality is offered as a security feature when employing a private key. It is kept as a secret key to ensure that one's personal code remains private and allows access to one's digital wallet, without which one cannot access one's digital assets (even by the owner). Only the recipient can decrypt the message using the correct private key.

###S

**SMART CONTRACTS**
Smart contracts are blockchain-based algorithms put into effect when meeting specific criteria. They are often used to automate the implementation of an agreement to assure all parties of the conclusion right away without the need for an intermediary or additional delay. They can also automate a workflow to execute the following action when certain circumstances are attained.

**STABLECOIN**
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that attempt to peg their market value to some external reference.
Stablecoins pegged to a currency like the U.S. dollar or to the price of a commodity such as gold make it more useful than the more-volatile cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange.

###T

**TOKENS**
On top of already existing blockchain networks, businesses or projects based on blockchain create these units of value. Although they frequently have close interoperability with the cryptocurrencies of that network, they belong to a different class of digital assets. In contrast to tokens produced by platforms built on top of those blockchains, cryptocurrencies are the native asset of a particular blockchain technology. As an illustration, a stablecoin like the Gemini dollar1 is a token on the Ethereum network, but Ether is the network's cryptocurrency.

###V

VIRTUAL CURRENCY
A digital representation of value is employed as a medium of commerce, a unit of account, or a store of value. Nevertheless, the US government does not recognize it as being legal tender.

###W

**WALLET**
Your digital assets' virtual home. Typically, storing bitcoins involves using an application (app) or web-based platform. Public and private keys are controlled and stored by wallets.
